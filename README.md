# Dog Breed Classifer
Image Classification using Pytorch

## Datasets:
This model was trained using the images of dogs of different breeds.

## Data Processing:
Exploratory analysis, cleaning, normalization, and train/test set splitting. Preprocessing steps included converting to cropping and scaling to 224x224px, and normalizing pixel intensity values between -1 and 1.

## Model Training:
The training was done using model from scratch as well as using Transfer Learning using VGG16.

## Model Evaluation:
Test accuracy using model from scratch turned out to be 11% while the test accuracy using transfer learning was 70%.
